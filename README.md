Design Patterns

This is a project implementing a Bee-Hive model. Initially, the beehive has a Queen Bee.
This beehive model performs different functions:
 - Reproducing new bees with different attributes.
 - Finding which bee does what activity at a particular time.
 
In order to implement this model, I have used some common Design Patterns:
1. Singleton Pattern
2. Builder Pattern
3. Decorator Pattern
4. Mediator Pattern
